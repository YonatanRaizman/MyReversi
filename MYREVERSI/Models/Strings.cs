Reversi (also known as Othello) is a two-player strategy game played on a green 8×8 board.\r\nThere are 64 discs, each black on one side and white on the other.\r\nAt the start of the game, the players decide who will play which color (or draw lots).\r\nThey then place two black discs and two white discs in the center of the board, diagonally from each other.\r\nEach player begins with 30 remaining discs to use during the game.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to place a disc so that it “sandwiches” one or more of your opponent’s discs between two of your own — either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\r\nAll of the opponent’s discs trapped this way are then flipped to your color.\r\n\r\nThe game ends when neither player can make a valid move, or when the board is completely filled.\r\nThe player with the greater number of discs showing their color at the end of the game is the winner.";
